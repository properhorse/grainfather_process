Brewing with grainfather:
=========================

Preparations:
-------------

- Check that all ingredients are available
- Make sure the filter is in
  - Add a SS mash wrapping to avoid loosing the rubber top.
  - Usa a hose clamp to fasten the filter
- Fill machine with mashing water
- Add inner bucket
- Heat water up to the FIRST mashing temperature
- Have 2 fermentation bucket starsan-cleaned, 1 half-full to dip unclean items

Mashing:
--------

- Pour grains in, stir to avoid dry patches
  - Add rice hulls if it's a wheat. More then the recipe says. 3dkg
- Push the top plate to gently touch the grains
- Start the mashing, set the pump to:
  -  half after 10mins, to increase eff.
  - slow enough to barely have any overflow
- Stop & stir during mashing to increase eff. if needed.

Meanwhile:
 - preheat sparging water

Sparging:
---------

 - Lift inner bucket up
 - Stir grains or not ?
 - Push down the top plate gently or not ?
 - Let it drip for 10 mins.
 - Pour sparging water.
   - Sparging water temperature matters or not ?
   - Have only 1cm layer of water on the top plate.
 - Measure (stif before) preboil gravity, preboil volume
   - If the eff. is low, use more water?
 - Add "spraymalt extra light" malt extract if the eff. is too low.

Meanwhile:
 - Increase the temp. to save time.

Boil:
-----

 - Stir and stay vigilant on the first 10 mins
 - Don't put on the top lid
 - Add hopps when needed
 - Scrap the bottom plate every 20 mins to avoid burn
 - Add cleaning tablet, yeast nutrition in the last 10 mins
 - Measure (stir first) postboil OG and postboil volume
 - Circulate boiling wort though the cooler
 - Do the whirpooling for 5-10mins, then let it rest for 5-10mins

Meanwhile:
 - Clean the inner bucket

Cooling:
--------

 - Remove the neoprene coating for cooling.
 - Circulate back into the machine to hit the desired temp. by adjusting the
 cool water flow/temp and pump speed.
 - Pump it out to the fermentation bucket. Don't aeriate it too much.
 - Add yeast and seal it with an air-lock.

Cleaning:
---------

 - Fill the machine with some water, add PBW, heat it up to 55C then start the
 pump.
 - Pump through the cooler.
 - Remove PBW water, replace with clean one, start the process over.

Fermenting:
-----------

 - 21 days in fermenter bucket if 2nd fermentation is in bottles.
 - Add hops after the first 2-3 days.
