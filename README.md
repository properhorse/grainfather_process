Sparging:
---------

 - Lift inner bucket up
 - Stir grains or not ?
 - Push down the top plate gently or not ?

 - Measure preboil gravity, preboil volume
   - If the eff. is low, use more water?

Boil:
-----

 - Stir and stay vigilant on the first 10 mins
 - Don't put on the top lid
 - Add hopps when needed
 - Add cleaning tablet, yeast nutrition in the last 10 mins

Cooling:
--------

 - Circulate back into the machine to hit the desired temp. by adjusting the
 cool water flow/temp and pump speed.
 - Pump it out to the fermentation bucket. Don't aeriate it too much.
